# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation System - ML Model with Flask Web App and Deployment

This project is a complete end-to-end **Crop Recommendation System** powered by Machine Learning and deployed as a Flask web application. It predicts the most suitable crop based on environmental and soil conditions to assist farmers in maximizing agricultural productivity.

---

## ðŸ”¬ Problem Statement

Modern agriculture requires intelligent decision-making based on data. The system predicts the best crop to cultivate based on inputs like:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Humidity (%)
- pH Level
- Rainfall (mm)

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Data preprocessing, scaling, and encoding.
- âœ… Multiple ML algorithms implemented:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - SVM
  - KNN
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Extra Trees
- âœ… Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- âœ… Model evaluation using Accuracy, F1 Score, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix.
- âœ… Automatic selection of the best model.
- âœ… Flask-based Web Application.
- âœ… Modern, responsive UI with HTML, CSS
